### When working with objects, the for-of loop and for-in loop can be used to iterate over the object's properties. Which of the following statements are correct?

- [x] The for-of loop will iterate over the object's own properties only when using the `Object.keys()` method to return an array to loop over.
- [x] The for-of loop will not iterate over the object and its prototype properties.
- [ ] The for-in loop will not iterate over the object and its properties.
