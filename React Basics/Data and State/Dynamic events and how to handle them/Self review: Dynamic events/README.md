### 1. In React, you are not allowed to code a separate function that should be run to handle a click event.

- [ ] True.
- [x] False.

### 2. Event-handling attributes in React are named almost the same as in HTML. Syntactically, the only difference is in the capitalization.

- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

### 3. What's wrong with this code?

```
<button onClick={handleClick()}>
  Click me
</button>
```

- [ ] The event-handling attribute should be all lowercased.
- [x] You cannot invoke an event-handling function from a JSX expression.
- [ ] This code should work.
