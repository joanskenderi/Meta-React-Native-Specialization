### You are creating a page for your app consisting of two components:

Parent: displays different information based on whether or not user has logged in. <br>
Child: contains an event handler that sends data to Parent when ‘Log in’ button is clicked.

### In this scenario, would it be better to use a stateful or stateless parent component?

- [x] Stateful.
- [ ] Stateless.
