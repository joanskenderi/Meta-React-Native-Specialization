### 1. You can declare a JavaScript function to be used as a component in React.

- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

### 2. You can spread the return statement over multiple lines by surrounding the code that follows the `return` keyword with an opening and a closing parenthesis.

- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

### 3. I​s this valid component code?

`function Example() { return (<h1>Example</h1>) }`

- [x] Yes.
- [ ] No.
- [ ] I​t would be valid, if it was spread over multiple lines.
