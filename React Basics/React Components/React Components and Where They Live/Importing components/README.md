### Imagine that you have an App component and a Footer component in the same location, at the root of the 'src' folder. Choose the proper way to import the Footer component into the App component.

- [x] `import Footer from "./Footer";`.
- [ ] `import Footer from Footer.js;`.
- [ ] `import "Footer" from "Footer";`.
- [ ] `<Footer />`.
