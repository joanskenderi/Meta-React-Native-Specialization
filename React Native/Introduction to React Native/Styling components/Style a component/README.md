## Scenario

The Little Lemon app currently has some styling applied to the components. However, you have been asked to update the styling to achieve a different appearance. You should utilize the `StyleSheet` API to abstract the styles from the componentâ€™s render. Make sure that the component code is readable and clean.

## Instructions

### **Step 1** Update Styles of Components to match Scenario

Your first step in this exercise is to update the styles of the given code to match the screenshot given in the scenario. Make sure to use the appropriate colors, padding and overall styling theme shown in the scenario.

### **Step 2** Extract All Styles to `StyleSheet` API

In this step, you will extract all the styles per component into its own `StyleSheet` API. This will ensure that your component code is readable. A best practice is to provide meaningful names to all your styles so that you can easily identify the style or where it is used.
