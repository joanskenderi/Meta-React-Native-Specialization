## Scenario

The Little Lemon app has a Welcome screen that is demonstrated in the image below. Currently, this screen is not scrollable. Because of the large font size used for the text, the contents do not fit within the confines of one screen, and users cannot view the content in full.

In order to make the content accessible, you have been asked to enhance the Welcome screen from the previous exercise to make it scrollable. You should also make sure that the scroll indicator is white, so it matches the Welcome screen styles.

## Instructions

### **Step 1** Enhance the Welcome screen to be Scrollable

In this step, you will use the existing code for the Welcome screen and enhance it to be a scrollable screen instead. Here you can use the `ScrollView` component, instead of the `View` component.

### **Step 2** Ensure that the scroll indicator is white in color

Next, you will include a prop to the `ScrollView` component to ensure that the scroll indicator is white in color.
