## Scenario

The Little Lemon app already has a header and footer component, and now you have been asked to create a Welcome screen for the app. This screen will contain a welcome message as demonstrated below:

## Instructions

### **Step 1** Create a Welcome Screen

Your first step is to create a Welcome screen. Create a file named WelcomeScreen.js within your source project folder. This will contain the code to display the welcome text.
The screen should display the following title:

"Welcome to Little Lemon"

Below this title you should have the following subheading:

"Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. We would love to hear more about your experience with us!"

### **Step 2** Style Welcome Screen

The next step is to add styles to your Welcome screen. Don't forget that this is a creative process, so feel free to choose any styles, font sizes and colors that you think suit the screenshot given in the scenario.

### **Step 3** Render the Welcome Screen from the App Component

In this step, you will call the Welcome screen that you created from the App component. This ensures that the Welcome screen is rendered on the app.
