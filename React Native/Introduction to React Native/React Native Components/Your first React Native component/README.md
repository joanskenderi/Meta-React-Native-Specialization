## Scenario

The Little Lemon app has a header component at the top that reads Little Lemon. However, you have also been asked to create a footer component for the app. You will use the `Text` and `View` components from React Native to achieve this. These components will then display the copyright information on all screens and appear at the very bottom of the screen.

## Instructions

### **Step 1** Create Footer Component

Your first step is to create a footer component. The footer component should display the following text:

### **Step 3** Call Footer Component from App Component

In the final step, you will import the footer component and render it from the app component. This ensures that the footer text is rendered on the screen.
